        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about? **This paper is about a structure/framework that makes it easy to \"tidy\" messy datasets.**\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish? **The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to simplify data organization and initial data analysis by already having established principles for cleaning.**\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" **The first sentence indicates that tidy data is standardized and can be linked with each other is some way, whereas messy data does not have this trait, and is in a sense, \"all over the place.\" The latter sentence indicates that when looking at a dtataset, what is a variable and what is an observation is easily distinguishable, but when defining the two more generally, they often overlap.**\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations? **Wickam defines values as numbers or strings depending on the dataset, variables as a collection of  values that measure a shared attribute, and observations as values measured on the same unit.**\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3? **\"Tidy data\" is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. Each variable forms a column, easy observation forms a row, each observational unit forms a table.**\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset? **The five most common problems with messy datasets are: column headers as values and not variable names, multiple varibles stored in one column, variables in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units in the same table or a single obervational unit in multiple tables. In table four, the column headers are numbers/values and not actual titles.**\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?  **Table 11 is messy because it has variables across rows and columns, not only individual columns. Table 12 is \"molten\" because the values of a column are variables.**\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?  **The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem is that tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it so in essence, they are linked. Wickham hopes that other frameworks for  issues associated with data cleaning (i.e missing values) will emerge making these tasks easier as well.**"

        "1. Numeric variable: For `./data/airbnb_hw.csv`, clean the `Price` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. How many missing values do you end up with? (Hint: What happens to the formatting when a price goes over 999 dollars, say from 675 to 1,112?) **To clean the data, I first wanted to see how \"dirty\" it was, and get familiar with it. I also wanted to see if the values were classifed as numeric and not objects. I then eliminated commas, and converted the values from objects to numeric values. After this, I did end up with missing values (181).**\n",
        "2. Categorical variable: For the `./data/sharks.csv` data covered in the lecture, clean the \"Type\" variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. **To clean this data I also used the .unique(), .value_counts(), and .describe() in order to see how \"dirty\" it was. I then saw many \"invalids\" and checked the data itself to see what they could be. I then renamed the variable to \"Possibly Attacked\" and combined the \"Under Investigation\" variable as well. I then combined the Boating, Boat, and Watercraft varibles under one variable: Boating. Others, such as \"Questionable\" or \"Unverified\" were listed as missing.**\n",
        "3. Dummy variable: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial` variable as well as you can, and, in particular, replace missing values with `np.nan`.\n",
        "4. Missing values, not at random: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. (Hint: Look at the `SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent` variable.) **A look at the codebook indicates that those listed as 4 or 9 were either missing, released, or etc, indicating that these could be classified as missing data, thus, these were updated to nans.**"

Why does data quality matter? **We gather these data in order to get a sense of what America's demographic looks like, but data such as this is important in politics and society as it can help with making policy with issues regarding race and civil rights. Data quality matters because the most accurate data will help make the most informed decision about these issues.**\n",

How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data? **One of the things that the Census did well was be accessible. The questionnaire can be accessed via the internet or by mail and etc. However, the U.S Census does not take into account gender identity or sexual orientation, which I would consider to be very important in our society today - it seems as though they ignore it. In the future, I think that we should aim to be more inclusive to the aspects above, as well as possibly religion. I think that these practices would be very beneficial if adopted much more widely - it would reflect the nuance and complexities that most people have.**\n",

Please provide a similar constructive criticism of their practices. **As I stated above, they indicated that they do not ask questions about gender or sex at birth - individuals can only choose male or female. Similar to the prior question, this choice ignores the nuance of inidividuals and is an incredibly important aspect of the data, especially for those who do not identify with either of those choices.**\n",

What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why? **When it comes to cleaning data, it may be a bit harder, as there may be more inconsistencies and errors since it cannot be captured with simple answer choices or categories. With missing values, it can be hard to replace to them, so they could potentially be eliminated from the set. I think that people may start adapting more effective data cleaning strategies to adapt to growing complexities.**\n",
        "6. Suppose someone invented an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality. What kinds of concerns would you have? **The major concerns are consent and privacy. Imputing values for characteristics that are unique to the indivudual that are considered \"protected\" is a major privacy violation, especially for those not giving consent. If someone chooses to withold that information, that is completely their choice.**"
